# Javascript

There is only one value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself, and that is
NaN (“not a number”).
console.log(NaN == NaN)
// → false


when null or undefined
occurs on either side of the operator, it produces true only if both sides are one
of null or undefined.
console.log(null == undefined);
// → true
console.log(null == 0);
// → false
